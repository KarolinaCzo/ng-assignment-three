# AssignmentThree

In this exercise the challenge was to:
1) Add a button which says 'Display details'
2) Add a paragraph with any content of your choice.
3) Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button created in the first step.
4) Log all button clicks - this could be simply an incrementing number.
5) Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (via ngClass)
